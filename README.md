# StarExplorer 🚀

**StarExplorer** is a classic 2D space shooter mobile game built using the **Corona SDK** (now Solar2D), with the scripting done in **Lua**. In this game, you pilot a lone spaceship in deep space, tasked with destroying incoming asteroids while dodging collisions. 

This was a passion project — part experiment, part nostalgia — where I explored 2D game mechanics, collision physics, sprite sheets, and simple UI elements in a lightweight game engine.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Solar2D / Corona SDK** (game engine)
- **Lua** (programming language)
- Physics engine (built-in)
- Sprite sheet animations
- Touch and timer-based controls
- Simple score and life tracking system

### 🎮 Gameplay
- Your spaceship is fixed at the bottom of the screen.
- Tap to fire lasers and destroy falling asteroids.
- Survive as long as possible. You have 3 lives — don’t let the asteroids hit your ship!
